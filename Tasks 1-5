#1. Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number:
import random
import time
time.sleep(2)
pokemon_number = (random.randint(1,151))

#2. Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number:
url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{}/'.format(pokemon_number)

#3. Create a dictionary that contains the returned pokemon's name, id, height and weight:
response = requests.get(url)
pokemon = response.json()

pprint(pokemon["name"])
print("ID Number:")
pprint(pokemon["id"])
print("Height:")
pprint(pokemon["height"])
print("Weight:")
pprint(pokemon["weight"])

#4. Get another random pokemon for their opponent:
print("Player 2, your pokemon is...")
pokemon_number = (random.randint(1,151))
url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{}/'.format(pokemon_number)
response = requests.get(url)
pokemon = response.json()

pprint(pokemon["name"])
print("ID Number:")
pprint(pokemon["id"])
print("Height:")
pprint(pokemon["height"])
print("Weight:")
pprint(pokemon["weight"])

#5. Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
input("Which stat do you want to use?")
